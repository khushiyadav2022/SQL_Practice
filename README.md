# SQL_Practice
Want confidence in SQL then do it- www.sql-practice.com

This repository is dedicated to students and professionals who would like to brush up and advance their SQL skills for their careers. I found (https://www.sql-practice.com) educational and the web site user friendly however there wasn’t the complete solution book shared on the web site neither on GitHub. So now you can get the answers with alternative solutions for each question

I have used PostgreSQL as main Database Management Systems (DBMS) and therefore you may encounter some queries that work in PostgreSQL may not work in other DBMS such as SQL Server or MySQL as some implementations slight vary in syntax. For such cases, for example, in date and time operations I included standart SQL queries as well.

I populated mockdata using www.mockaroo.com to effectively practise the queries and get some output while working locally. Note that it is not the same large dataset used on the web site, so I suggest you use the web site itself as long as you have internet connection, which is also good for tracking your progress. You may use the.sql database file given in the repository for convenience and a rapid start in creating schemas and inserting datasets.

The test contains 50 questions and consists of 3 category:

- Easy <br>
- Medium <br>
- Hard <br>

You can use the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to figure out what data to store, the entities, their attributes and also how entities relate to other entities.

Questions 1- 23

1. Show unique birth years from patients and order them by ascending.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT year(birth_date) AS birth_year
FROM patients
ORDER BY birth_year ASC;
```

2. Show unique first names from the patients table which only occurs once in the list.
   For example, if two or more people are named 'John' in the first_name column then don't include their name in the output list.
   If only 1 person is named 'Leo' then include them in the output.

```sql
SELECT first_name
FROM patients
GROUP BY first_name
HAVING COUNT(first_name = 'John') = 1;
```

    Tip: HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.

3. Show patient_id and first_name from patients where their first_name start and ends with 's' and is at least 6 characters long.

```sql
SELECT patient_id, first_name
FROM patients

WHERE first_name LIKE 's____%s';
```

4. Show patient_id, first_name, last_name from patients whos diagnosis is 'Dementia'.
   Primary diagnosis is stored in the admissions table.

```sql
SELECT p.patient_id, p.first_name, p.last_name
FROM patients p
         JOIN admissions a ON p.patient_id = a.patient_id
WHERE diagnosis = 'Dementia';
```

5. Display every patient's first_name.
   Order the list by the length of each name and then by alphbetically.

```sql

```

6. Show the total amount of male patients and the total amount of female patients in the patients table.
   Display the two results in the same row.

```sql
-- alternate #1
SELECT COUNT(patient_id)
FROM patients group by GENDER;

-- SQL
SELECT SUM(gender = 'M') AS male_count,
       SUM(gender = 'F') AS female_count
FROM patients;
```

7. Show first and last name, allergies from patients which have allergies to either 'Penicillin' or 'Morphine'. Show results ordered ascending by allergies then by first_name then by last_name.

WHERE allergies = 'Penicillin'
   OR allergies = 'Morphine'
ORDER BY allergies ASC, first_name ASC, last_name ASC;

-- alternatively 

SELECT first_name,
       last_name,
       allergies

WHERE allergies IN ('Penicillin', 'Morphine')
ORDER BY allergies,
         first_name,
         last_name;
```

8. Show patient_id, diagnosis from admissions. Find patients admitted multiple times for the same diagnosis.

FROM doctors;
```

11. Show all allergies ordered by popularity. Remove NULL values from query.

```sql
SELECT allergies, COUNT(*) AS total_diagnosis
FROM patients
WHERE allergies IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY allergies
ORDER BY total_diagnosis DESC;
```

12. Show all patient's first_name, last_name, and birth_date who were born in the 1970s decade.
    Sort the list starting from the earliest birth_date.

ORDER BY birth_date ASC
```

13. We want to display each patient's full name in a single column.
    Their last_name in all upper letters must appear first, then first_name in all lower case letters.
    Separate the last_name and first_name with a comma. Order the list by the first_name in decending order

FROM admissions
GROUP BY day_number
ORDER BY number_of_admissions DESC;

-- SQL

FROM admissions
GROUP BY day_number
ORDER BY number_of_admissions DESC;
```

17. Show all columns for patient_id 542's most recent admission_date.

```sql
-- PostgreSQL

WHERE patient_id = 542
ORDER BY admission_date DESC
LIMIT 1;

```

18. Show patient_id, attending_doctor_id, and diagnosis for admissions that match one of the two criteria:
    - patient_id is an odd number and attending_doctor_id is either 1, 5, or 19.
    - attending_doctor_id contains a 2 and the length of patient_id is 3 characters.

```sql
-- PostgreSQL (we would need to explicity cast the type attending_doctor_id is integer whereas LIKE method performs operations on Strings
SELECT patient_id, attending_doctor_id, diagnosis
FROM admissions
WHERE patient_id % 2 = 1 AND attending_doctor_id IN (1, 5, 19)
   OR CONCAT(attending_doctor_id) LIKE '%2%' AND LENGTH(CONCAT(patient_id)) = 3;

-- SQL
SELECT patient_id, attending_doctor_id, diagnosis
FROM admissions
WHERE patient_id % 2 = 1 AND attending_doctor_id IN (1, 5, 19)
   OR (attending_doctor_id LIKE '%2%' AND LENGTH(patient_id) = 3);

---SQL
SELECT patient_id, attending_doctor_id, diagnosis from admissions
where (patient_id % 2)!=0 and attending_doctor_id in (1,5,19)
or attending_doctor_id like '%2%' and len(patient_id)=3;
```

19. Show first_name, last_name, and the total number of admissions attended for each doctor.
    Every admission has been attended by a doctor.

```sql

FROM admissions
         JOIN doctors ON admissions.attending_doctor_id = doctors.doctor_id
GROUP BY first_name, last_name;
 
---SQL
SELECT first_name, last_name, count(doctor_id) from doctors join admissions  on doctors.doctor_id = admissions.attending_doctor_id
group by first_name, last_name;
```

20. For each doctor, display their id, full name, and the first and last admission date they attended.

       CONCAT(d.first_name, ' ', d.last_name) AS full_name,
       MIN(a.admission_date)                  AS first_admission_date,
       MAX(a.admission_date)                  AS last_admission_date
FROM doctors d
         JOIN admissions a ON d.doctor_id = a.attending_doctor_id
GROUP BY d.doctor_id, full_name;
```

21. Display the total amount of patients for each province. Order by descending.

```sql
SELECT pro.province_name, COUNT(p.patient_id) AS patient_count
FROM province_names pro
         JOIN patients p ON pro.province_id = p.province_id
GROUP BY pro.province_name
ORDER BY patient_count DESC;
```

22. For every admission, display the patient's full name, their admission diagnosis, and their doctor's full name who diagnosed their problem.

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(p.first_name, ' ', p.last_name) AS patient_name, a.diagnosis, CONCAT(d.first_name, ' ', d.last_name) AS doctor_name
FROM patients p
         JOIN admissions a ON p.patient_id = a.patient_id
         JOIN doctors d ON a.attending_doctor_id = d.doctor_id;
```

23. Display the number of duplicate patients based on their first_name and last_name.

```sql

SELECT first_name, last_name, COUNT(*) AS number_of_duplicates
FROM patients
GROUP BY first_name, last_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

/*
In the HAVING clause, you can only use the names of columns that are included in the GROUP BY clause 
or that are aggregated by an aggregate function (such as COUNT, MAX, MIN, etc.).

In this case, the COUNT(*) function is used to count the number of rows in each group, 
and the result of this function is given an alias of "number_of_duplicates".
However, the HAVING clause does not refer to this alias. Instead, it refers to the function itself (i.e. COUNT(*)).
*/

```
